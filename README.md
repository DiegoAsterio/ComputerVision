# Computer Vision

Computer vision library developed with python and some test cases.

The project splits into:

1. Filters and edges:

  * Convolute using a Gaussian mask
  * Convolute using a Laplacian-of-Gaussian mask
  * Some filters using separable and derived kernels
  * Gaussian pyramid
  * Laplacian pyramid
  * Support for grayscale hybrid images
