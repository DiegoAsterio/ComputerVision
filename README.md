# Computer Vision

Computer vision library developed with python and some test cases.

The project splits into:

1. Filters and edges

··1. Convolute using a Gaussian mask
··2. Convolute using a Laplacian-of-Gaussian mask
··3. Some filters using separable and derived kernels
··4. Gaussian pyramid
··5. Laplacian pyramid
··6. Support for grayscale hybrid images
